Gates said the next step for the project is to pitch the concept to manufacturers,
saying he expects the market for the toilets to be over $6 billion by 2030.

The billionaire also lauded the globalized and free trade systems that made the toilet 
technology possible.

"I honestly believe trade allows every country to do what it's best at," he told Reuters
in an interview. "So when I talk about components of this toilet being made in China, others in Thailand, others in the United States â€” you really want to be bringing together all of that IQ so that you're getting that combination."
