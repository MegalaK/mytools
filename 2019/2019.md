There are several benefits that can be achieved with this solution, including:

Agility across the ML pipeline by automating the install, provisioning, and autoscaling of the containers based ML models/frameworks.  NVIDIA GPUs can help speed up the massive computational tasks required to train, test, and fine tune the ML models without having to buy more compute and storage resources, with Red Hat OpenShift serving as the container and Kubernetes based “self service cloud.”

Portability and flexibility for ML powered apps to be developed and delivered across data center, edge, and public clouds. OpenShift also provides flexibility to offer ML-as-a-service to apps without having to embed the ML models directly in the application code for production use.

Efficient operations and lifecycle management for ML powered intelligent applications with automation of the CI/CD process, enabling more efficient collaboration and helping to boost productivity.

The Userdata Team owns a 15 TB cache of user and device profiles. They build the pipelines to keep this data up-to-date and intelligently synchronized with multiple sources. This cache is queried in real-time, at high volume, and must always contain fresh data. The team is constantly experimenting with new technologies and leverages a wide range of data storage and processing techniques ranging from cloud data warehouses to sub-millisecond lookup key/value stores.
